        "   **THEORY QUESTIONS**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        " -  a method is essentially a function that is tied to an object and typically operates on that object, while a function can exist independently and is not tied to any object.\n",
        "2. 2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        " - FUNCTION PARAMETERS-\n",
        "     - Parameters are the variables defined in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it is called.\n",
        "     - Parameters are listed in the function's definition, inside the parentheses.   \n",
        " - FUNCTION ARGUMENTS-\n",
        "     - Arguments are the actual values or data passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the function's parameters.\n",
        "     - The arguments are the real values you provide when you call a function, matching the parameters defined in the function.\n",
        "3.  What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        " - Basic Function: Defined using def and called with or without arguments.\n",
        " - Function with Default Arguments: Parameters have default values that are used if no argument is provided.\n",
        " - Keyword Arguments: Arguments passed using the parameter names, allowing flexibility in their order.\n",
        " - Variable-Length Arguments: Use *args for a variable number of positional arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments.\n",
        " - Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions defined using lambda for short, one-liner functions.\n",
        " - Higher-Order Functions: Functions that accept other functions as arguments.\n",
        " - Recursive Functions: Functions that call themselves to solve problems.\n",
        "\n",
        " These various methods provide flexibility in defining and using functions in Python, depending on the needs of your program.\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        " - The return statement in a Python function serves the primary purpose of exiting the function and sending back a value to the caller. When a function is called, the return statement allows it to send a result (or no result) back to the code that called it, thus enabling the function to output a value.\n",
        "5.  What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " - iterators and iterables are closely related concepts that are used for looping over sequences of data.\n",
        " - The distinction between the two is that iterables allow you to define a collection of items, while iterators enable you to step through the collection.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        " - In Python, a generator is a special type of iterable that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily (i.e., one at a time, on demand). Unlike a list, which stores all of its values in memory, a generator computes its values as they are requested, which makes it more memory efficient for working with large datasets.\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        " - Generators are powerful tools in Python, offering memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, and the ability to handle infinite sequences effectively. They make your code more concise, maintainable, and efficient, especially when working with large datasets or streaming data. Regular functions are better suited for simpler tasks where memory usage and performance aren't critical, but for larger, more complex operations, generators are often the preferred choice.\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        " - A lambda function is a compact, anonymous function used primarily for small, one-time operations where defining a full function with def would be unnecessary. It is typically used for functional programming tasks like mapping, filtering, or sorting. While lambda functions are very useful for concise operations, they are best suited for simple tasks, and more complex logic is usually better written in a regular function.\n",
        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python?\n",
        " - The map() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to apply a specified function to every item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and return a map object (which is an iterator). The purpose of map() is to make it easier to apply a function to each item in an iterable in a concise, functional programming style, rather than using a loop.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        " - map(): Applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns an iterable with the transformed elements.\n",
        " - reduce(): Reduces an iterable to a single value by applying a function cumulatively to its items.\n",
        " - filter(): Filters an iterable by applying a function that returns True or False, keeping only those elements that satisfy the condition.  \n",
        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given list :[47,11,42,13]\n",

        " result = reduce(lambda x,y:x+y,[47,11,42,13])\n",
        " print(result) #output:113\n",
